# chibi-prompt
More general version of Chibi.

### Weird stuff
* Fixing the width of the `.command` prompt *fixed* the issue with commands
overflowing their containing `Element`. Bascially the console got messed up
when a command wrapped but now that that the width of the console is fixed in 
CSS this no longer seems to be an issue.

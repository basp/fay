# Fay
Fay is part of the ongoing https://github.com/basp/ambiance-vm effort trying
to tackle some client facing edges. It has two main focus points:

* Providing a clean, flexible and sturdy browser client (start with 
`index.ts`)
* Iplement the code rewriter that produces an intermediate result for a 
higher level programming language based roughly on ES and mooscript (start 
with `sandbox.ts`)

How these ended up in this repository I can't really tell. Just a bad call of
jdudgement I guess. Also, be warned that this is still in the early sandboxing
stage so use what you can't use but do clone/copy/whatever because this thing
is heavily in flux.
